This plugin provides a new custom field type to Movable Type Pro users.
This new field type, called a "multi-checkbox" allows one to have multiple
checkbox as opposed to a single checkbox. A new template tag will also be 
defined for these custom fields to determine whether or not a checkbox has
been checked.

# Usage

1. Create a new Custom Field. 

2. Select "Checkbox (Multi)" as the field's type.

3. In the Options text area that appears enter the value of each checkbox
   delimiting each value by a comma. E.g. "Blue,Yellow,Red".
